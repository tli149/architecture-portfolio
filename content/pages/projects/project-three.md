A major problem of contemporary architectural education
 is the elitist top-down pedagogy that focuses on incubated/
isolated abstractions and speculations without addressing the
 rich entanglement of disciplines and networks crucial to **the
 dynamic civic contexts** we operate in. The choice of sitting in an
 architecture school is **a meta critique of our tendency to view
 the ‘public’ as static scenarios**; the intervention of **inserting
 a living archive** in its agora, and **a campus corridor for the
 public to access**, is a provocation of how the dynamic politics
 of difference should inform and challenge the way we design for
 communities. The project introduces **two walls of knowledge** to
 replace the original walls which separate professional spaces apart
 from the public atrium space.
